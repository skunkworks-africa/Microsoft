# Getting Started with PowerShell Scripting

Welcome to the PowerShell scripting guide! This document is designed to help you get started with PowerShell, whether you're new to scripting or looking to enhance your skills.

## Introduction to PowerShell

PowerShell is a powerful scripting language and shell developed by Microsoft. It's used for automating the administration of systems, managing configurations, and generally speeding up repetitive tasks.

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Install PowerShell**:
   - Windows: PowerShell comes pre-installed.
   - macOS/Linux: Install via [PowerShell GitHub repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

2. **Setting Up Your IDE**:
   - Recommended IDEs for PowerShell scripting include Visual Studio Code with the PowerShell extension, PowerShell ISE, or any text editor of your choice.

3. **Running Your First Script**:
   - Create a new file with a `.ps1` extension.
   - Write a simple script, for example: `Write-Host "Hello, PowerShell!"`.
   - Run the script by navigating to its directory in PowerShell and typing `.\yourscriptname.ps1`.

## Exploring the Repository

- The repository is organized into directories based on skill level: `beginner`, `intermediate`, and `advanced`.
- Browse through these directories to find scripts that match your skill level.

## Next Steps
