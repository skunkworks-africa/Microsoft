# Enhancing Your PowerShell Skills

Welcome to our interactive guide on modifying example PowerShell scripts. This guide will walk you through adding new features to `Example1.ps1` and `Example2.ps1`, helping you learn and apply PowerShell scripting in a practical way.

## Modifying `Example1.ps1`

### Objective
Enhance `Example1.ps1` to display the system's IP address along with the existing system information.
